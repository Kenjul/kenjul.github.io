    <h2 id= "about-me"> About Me </h2>
     <p> During high school I had aspirations of being an aerospace engineer (due to being interested in flight and space back in the day), 
      but years after I've realized that I wanted to pursue sales and business. It always intrigued me to learn how to communicate effectively
      and also learning how to influence others for the better. In my mind, it made sense to learn how to sell since it would be applicable in all aspects of life.
      I've learned that you constantly sell yourself daily to everyone you interact with, including potential interviewers for your next career, bosses, friends that you 
      want to befriend, etc. 
     </p>
     <p> Currently, I've heard about coding bootcamps and I've always wanted to learn since I've tried multiple times and given up throughout my childhood due to it being 
      too difficult (or so I thought at the time). Granted, it is still difficult, I'm excited to keep pressing on and pushing myself through challenging experiences 
      to keep growing my resume, skillsets, and ability to create in the future. I believe that tech is only going to keep growing and being more relevant so I should 
      definitely try to future-proof myself by learning these languages now. 
     </p>
       <p> All in all, I'm excited to learn as much as I can with Thinkful so I can better equip myself to be a quality leader to those I'm around. </p>
    <h3> Interests </h3>
    <ul> Building gaming PCs </ul>
    <ul> Valorant, CSGO, WOW, Maplestory, etc. (list would be too long...) </ul>
    <ul> Volleyball (I play setter) </ul>
    <ul> Photography and editting </ul>
       <p> I moved to Hawaii in 2019 after working for a sales company for 1 year and while being there, I befriended gamers that also played volleyball. 
        Nowadays, I mainly find myself playing volleyball moreso than gaming but gaming has always been my go-to from a very young age. I built my first PC in
        6th grade and I've been obsessed since. </p>
